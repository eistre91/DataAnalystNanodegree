Summary

I used the Prosper Loans dataset for these visualizations, which is company that facilitates person-to-person lending. The visualizations explore Loan Status (or Turnout), which is whether a loan is paid-in-full or defaulted, and its relationship with whether friends invested in the loan. The final finding is that loans are a bit more likely to be paid back if loans were invested in by friends. 

Design

The initial design was to go for something simple to communicate a statistically significant difference in the data for loan turnout when friends invested and did not invest. I settled on bar graphs and stacked bar graphs since I trying to mainly communicate counts of categorical variables, as well as their proportional size. 

A lot of the design decisions that evolved through feedback were the wording in setting the context of the visualizations. A very helpful piece of feedback was observing that two graphs could be consolidated into one to make a better comparison. Previously, I had overall counts of loan turnout filtered for those loans with friends invested, and overall counts of loan turnout for those loans without friends invested. These two were combined into a single graph, which facilitates a comparison with the proportional graph that follows.

Feedback

Person 1

A lot of notes on wording in the summary and in axis titles which helps make it a lot clearer to laymen, like paid-in-full vs paid and loan vs listing. Renamed loan status to loan turnout in the graphs themselves. 

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

To make loans to friends since they pay back at better rates.

Person 2

The graphs were found to be pretty straightforward. No changes were really suggested other than a typo fix.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

That loans from friends are paid back at about the same rate as others.

Person 3

A lot of helpful feedback on wording and also consolidating two different graphs about overall counts between friend statuses.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

Slightly more likely to pay back loans where your friend is invested. Not sure about causation.
