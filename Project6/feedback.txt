Feedback - Person 1

A lot of notes on wording in the summary and in axis titles which helps make it a lot clearer to laymen, like paid-in-full vs paid and loan vs listing. Renamed loan status to loan turnout in the graphs themselves. 

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

To make loans to friends since they pay back at better rates.

Feedback - Person 2

The graphs were found to be pretty straightforward. No changes were really suggested other than a typo fix.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

That loans from friends are paid back at about the same rate as others.
